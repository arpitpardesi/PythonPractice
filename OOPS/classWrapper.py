'''
A function in Python is a first-order object. A function can have another function as its argument and wrap another function definition inside it. This helps in modifying a function without actually changing it. Such functions are called decorators.

This feature is also available for wrapping a class. This technique is used to manage the class after it is instantiated by wrapping its logic inside a decorator.
